# Scripts

These are some common useful scripts used by the center to perform common tasks (such as backing up a database or exporting data). Please add your own scripts here if you find yourself running them often!

## Envs

ENV files are found in the `envs/` folder and protected by `git-secret`; scripts include a file by sourcing it and this can be edited based on the database or API you are targeting.
